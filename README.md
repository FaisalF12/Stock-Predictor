Stock Market Research.docx is an explanation of my research in the format of a research paper, and the file Stock Market Results.xlsx is the results of my research if my model was used to make investment decisions from the last quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2018.  This model achieved a 384.89% return during this period which was just under three times how the S&P500 performed.
